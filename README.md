# python-api-challenge.
In this project I was tasked to:
1. Generate random geographic coordinates and the nearest city to each latitude and longitude combination
2. Use the OpenWeatherMap API to retrieve weather data from the cities list generated
3. Create a series of scatter plots to showcase the following relationships:
- Latitude vs. Temperature
- Latitude vs. Humidity
- Latitude vs. Cloudiness
- Latitude vs. Wind Speed
4. Compute the linear regression for each relationship. Separate the plots into Northern Hemisphere (greater than or equal to 0 degrees latitude) and Southern Hemisphere (less than 0 degrees latitude)
5. Use the Geoapify API and the geoViews Python library and create map visualizations.
- Create a map that displays a point for every city found before and the size of the point correlates to the humidity in each city
6. Narrow down the cities to cities with ideal weather conditions (i.e, good temperature, low humidity and cloudiness)
7. For each city, use the Geoapify API to find the first hotel located within 10,000 meters of your coordinates and add the hotel name and the country as additional information in the hover message for each city on the map.
